No-one (but Rizz and I) used it, and I use Ubuntu (Linux) quite a lot these days... and I doubt such a complex piece of software could easily be ported over. I did look into Mono Developer, which can apparently port .NET 2 programs over to MAC and Linux, but frankly because DUMb wasn&apos;t really used, what&apos;s the point?' +
  '</li><li>I hope to make a Mono Port of Private Diary though, and perhaps make a C version of it that can be built on anything... I&apos;d like to be able to use it in Ubuntu at least.' +
  '</li><li>Hopefully I can muster up some enthusiasm for programming some time soon also as I&apos;d like to make a web version of my Countdown Timer if nothing else - I burnt my dinner as I was using Ubuntu at dinner time! I should be able to make a web version fairly simply - it is mostly a timer after all, though I doubt I&apos;ll be able to make it grab focus like the real one does - Sound will be do-able though. Amazingly, I could not find a decent countdown timer in Ubuntu&apos;s Repositories!' +

  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> The <q>Real-Time</q> monitoring of other DUMbasic apps on LAN now uses a single persistent port (It was creating a new UDPClient each second, using it, then closing it. Now it just reuses one - hasn&apos;t been bug-tested as yet with connections dropping out etc., but I&apos;ve included it because it is more efficient)' +

  '<span class="B">v0.9.9.7 Released 13:01 on Tuesday 31st January 2012</span>' +
  '(This is a massive update, though chances are you&apos;ll see very little (if any) difference day-to-day.' +
  '<ul><li><span class="B"> Known Issues:</span>' +
  'Under Linux, since Raw Sockets arn&apos;t implemented in Mono as yet, DUMbasic will automatically use Simple monitoring. Also, I find that (for some as yet unknown reason) 64b/s down and 4b/s up (With Real-Time monitoring of other clients on) are added on to my DUMbasic in Simple under Linux(Ubuntu) - I&apos;m looking into why this might be, but for the mean time I&apos;ve added <q>Manual Adjusting</q> in Settings>Preferences. This <q>workaround</q> semi-fixes the issue in case there is nothing I can do about it code-wise.' +
  '</li></ul>' +
  '<hr>' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Made start-up <q>quicker</q> (by putting more start-up stuff on a separate Thread)' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Made the window movement (when dragging it about) much more efficient and accurate' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Made the Auto Update Code rock solid in theory. (Tested on my PC and a VM of LXDE(Ubuntu-Based) Linux) and yes, I do remember when I said exactly the same thing a year or two ago...lol - hopefully this time it really IS!' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Compatibility:</span> AVG Deletes the Start up Registry entry. I assume because I refresh it on every start-up. It now doens&apos;t refresh, meaning if you move DUMbasic, you will have to manually uncheck the <q>Run When Computer Starts</q> check-box, then check it again to get the new start-up path put in there.' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">New Feature:</span> Support for manual adjustment - if DUMbasic shows something other than 0B/s all the time - when there isn&apos;t any traffic; use with care - verify there is really no traffic via another utility such as Task Manager/System Monitor (This happens to me with Mono/Linux on LAN using Download/Upload Type: Simple).' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> (hopefully) made the adding of a new user better - this happens every month when everything is reset. new code should properly sort the users as they are in History, so the progress-bars are the same colour sequence in both windows.' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Made DUMbasic compatible with Linux&apos;s version of the MAC Address cache (At least the version in Ubuntu) - this means that you no longer need to use Mobile Dongle mode for Linux' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Bug-fix:</span> If Upload or Download wasn&apos;t monitored, the amount wouldn&apos;t be shown in Real-Time Monitoring on other DUMbasics in the LAN.' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Bug-fix:</span> Mono/Linux - some dodgyness in the Mono Code meant that hiding the Task-bar Icon somehow made two different Forms appear. I fixed by making the icon visible for a millisecond or so on start-up before it is hidden.' +
  '</li></ul>' +
  '<hr>' +
  '<span class="B">v0.9.9.6 Released 19:06 16th January 2012</span>' +
  '<ul><li><span class="B">Bug-fix:</span> Fixed a bug where you can&apos;t change Network Interface Cards after one has been set (without manually editing the Settings file)' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Changed .Net Framework to version 2.0 which is about 10 times smaller than .Net 3.5 SP1... and more supported in Mono.' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Enhanced ability to switch between Mobile Dongle and <q>Normal</q> Network Interface Card' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Made the single-click show/hide from the tray icon more efficient.' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Compatibility:</span> Compatibility improvements for Mono(Linux/Mac/etc.). At this point, it is VERY difficult to get through the First-Run Wizard, but if you copy/paste your settings and other files from your Windows/.NET one, it&apos;ll ask to change Hosts and you&apos;ll have to re-set up your network card (as both will be different on a different OS).

  '\<span class="B">v0.9.9.3 Released 20.08 on 24th November 2011</span>' +
  '<ul><li><span class="B">New Feature:</span> I found out today that Mobile Broadband Dongles don&apos;t give the OS a Hardware MAC address for the Address Resolution Protocol cache. Because I base the File names on that MAC Address, DUMbasic would only work until it, or the computer was shut down; Nothing could be saved but the generic Settings file. This update adds the necessary support for (hopefully) comprehensively supporting Mobile Broadband Dongles.

  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Make enter/return capture the input and put in CR+LF so that line endings are universal over all OSs.' +
  '</li><li><span class="B">Improvement:</span> Change the mouse-over (Mouse-enter/Mouse-leave) code for the day/month/year thing so that it uses a memory dim to know if the mouse if hovering over one of them... so that focus doesn&apos;t have to be ON the labels implicitly... take out that annoying label/Focus() crud.' +
